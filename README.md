RECOMMENDATIONS: 
    Base on the findings and analysis from the visualization. I humbly recommend the following  
🔶 The Marketing Specialist should be increased by headcount so as to improve on their role in making out special market strategies and sales of product 
🔶 The gender distribution is normal and has it's perfection base on sales because is like that females sales most of the product and employment should be channelled mostly on them 
🔶 The salaries paid to Product Managers should be on qualifications, experience and dedication. Also other positions which the highest qualifications and experience should be considered for promotion or bonus base on their dedication 
🔶 The leave balance for Job role base on qualifications seems perfect 

Thanks
